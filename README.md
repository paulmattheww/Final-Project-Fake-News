## Notes On Using GitHub

Start by making a branch for yourself.  In the terminal navigate to this repository.  Then do the following:

```bash
git branch _branchname_
git checkout _branchname_
```

Now you will be on your own branch that will not affect the `master` branch.  As a best practice this is preferred.  

When you make changes that you want to push up to your branch for backup and future merging, do the following:

```bash
git add . # or the specific file name
git commit -m "message about commit"
git push
```

This will push your files up to GitHub.  

When you want to merge with the `master` please contact Paul W.
